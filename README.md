A species mod based off of the shapeshifters from Splatoon, the Inklings!
Grab your gear and start exploring, because now you can take to the cosmos as a squid!

## Features
- A custom cephalopod species with their own unique pet, semi-custom ship, full custom dialogue and object descriptions, and all that jazz.
- Tons of custom colors and hairstyles to pick from.
- Entirely too many weapons, tiered and otherwise.
- Fully-tiered armor sets, with some tiers having multiple distinct armor sets.
- An assortment of custom clothing made just for Inklings.
- Lots and lots of custom objects based off of the world of Splatoon and Inkling culture.
- So much crafting? 10+ custom foods, 10+ custom codices, buffs, explosives, a custom crop and more!
- Five custom vendor stalls that sell assorted clothing and useful goods. One of them only accepts sea snails as currency, however, so be sure to hold onto those if you find them while exploring the galaxy!
- A new planet type, the Flooded biome. Inspired by the post-human Earth of Splatoon and built off of Oceanic planets, these planets have an assortment of ruins, resources and residents that make them worth a visit!
- And so much more? There's a lot in this mod.

## Dependencies
- This mod requires a species extender for Inklings to be a playable race. This is a pretty good one: [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=729426722).
- This mod is fully compatible with Frackin Races, although Inklings are not listed on the main webpage for the mod.
- This mod is overall designed to be as compatible with as many things as possible. If you discover incompatibilities, please contact me!

## "Bugs" & FAQ
- Vanilla races may experience clipping if they try to wear Inkling chest items. Head and leg clothing should be fine.
- Similarly, Inklings look funny with some vanilla Starbound clothing on them. But that's just how it is.
- Depending on the dungeons that spawn on a Flooded planet, the game may take extra time to load the planet upon first generating it.
This is completely normal due to the game not normally loading some dungeons in an ocean setting: please be patient with the game and allow it to fully load the planet.
- Characters that exist before the V2.0.0 Beta update may not find Flooded planets in their associated universes. For best results, create a new character or visit the universe of one!
- Octo Expansion content is unlocked by buying and using a CQ-80 from the Outpost's Octoling vendor; it's like this for thematic and spoiler reasons! You may also rarely find CQ-80s in treasure chests on Oceanic and Flooded planets.

- There are currently no game-breaking bugs to my knowledge. Please contact me if you discover any, I want to fix them!
