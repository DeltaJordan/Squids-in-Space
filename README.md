A species mod based off of the shapeshifters from Splatoon, the Inklings!
Grab your gear and start exploring, because now you can take to the cosmos as a squid!

## Features
- Tons of colors and tentacle styles to make your own unique cephalopod.
- Fully-tiered armor and weapons, with 9 different weapon types at your disposal. (And a few joke weapons too.)
- Weapon customization and recoloring! Change your weapon's look, element and even ability to make it work to your liking.
- Five custom vendors based off of the Booyah Base shops in Splatoon. They'll sell you all sorts of custom clothing and weapons, as well as swap rare treasure for a tasty sea snail or two.
- A custom SAIL AI featuring Judd the cat! He's taking a break from judging turf war matches so he can guide you through the stars.
- A semi-custom ship and fully custom ship pet!
- Tons of Inkling-inspired furniture so that wherever you go, you'll be comfortable.
- Custom codexes exploring the lives, lore and history of the Inkling race! You can craft them at the Inkling Bookbinding Kit.
- Fully-functional Inkling tenants and guards! See if you can get them to show up in your colonies, they're quite friendly.
- And a lot more, including fun custom throwables, craftable buffs, custom object scan descriptions, and a lot more.

## Dependencies
A character extender, preferrably Xbawks Character Extender on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=729426722).

## Known Bugs
- Inkling hats and shirts may look funny on other races, because Inklings have large ears and sleek bodies that their clothes are meant to accomodate. Other races should be able to wear their pants/shoes just fine.
- Small pixel errors near the end of the respawn animation-- working on this.
- There's some issue with customized Brushes & Rollers with a weapon mod somewhere. I don't know what it is because the only bug report didn't tell me what mods they were using. >:(
