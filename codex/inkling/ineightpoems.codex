"Flawless crispy shrimp
crunches sweetly on my beak.

And then I recall, from early days!

The soggy squishy breading 
of yesterday's fried things.


''Fried Shwaffle'', 04/22/2734",

"How many times have I tried?

One by one they leap, 
their eyes on the prize,
across green tides to the goal.

I shout once more, 
and the orb is gone.


''Girl Power'', ??/??/2732",

"What is it I'm making?

The template sits without a word,
with wagless tail and pointed ears.

Us cephalopods, we have only cats!


''Canines from Boxes'', 02/04/2734",

"Flashing voices, trilling lights,
it's all a familiar delight.

Both here and below seem to adore
the idea of music and conflict!

I'll take celebration any day.


''A Concert Trend'', 13/08/2733",

"Vending machines hold lots of treats,
and meals on desperate days.

This one has only canned meat: 
it's adrift in bright green ooze.

Never again will I eat this!


''It Tastes Like Soap'', ??/??/2732",

"Sighted on the TV: 
fish out of water, 
pans in their hands.

I could never collect their eggs!

They remind me of smiling friends,
of sucker-pads and dainty legs.


''Salmonid'', 04/10/2733",

"Aflight, afright, 
I moved as a shadow in night.

Until then, I hadn't known
how hope had ever sounded.

And so it seems to sound like
drawn-out notes and profanity!


''Hope'', 16/02/2732",

"Death itself loomed in the harbor.

At once, a thousand things: 
life, love, hope and horror 
all mingle.

Was it not my burden, 
it would have been
the most beautiful thing in the world.


''A Hundred and Eighty Seconds'', 15/29/2732"
