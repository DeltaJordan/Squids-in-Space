"Our capital has fallen.

It was a foolish gambit, really, putting all our faith into power wired up like that: it was begging for disaster. And, of course, that's exactly what happened.
A wire comes loose and it all goes to the abyss. Our forces were too exhausted to even try and defend any longer.

We can only admit defeat. We never deserved this.",

"The shogun and her consort are failing to answer all forms of communication. Telegraphs, letters, there's nothing.

It's been two days, and there's no way to know: the Dofleini-E Division and I are too far away to see for ourselves.

Have they deserted us? Are they dead? For once, not even music calms my nerves.",

"We have returned to Takoku, and the shogunate has been decimated. Cephiwa and Octaiki are nowhere to be found, and rumors stir: they're dead, they're prisoners, they've fled.

But there's no point in caring for them now. Takoku is in crisis, and hundreds of soldiers have died for their cause.

Now there is only forward, to pick up the pieces and see what the treaties have to say.",

"Not only do they force permission to station troops on the surface and in our very homes, but we cannot leave the capital.
Society can run as it would, but we're allowed no formal army and no weapon production, no freedom of movement.

Pathetic, really, to think our kinds were once friends. Past history of camadarie doesn't matter when resources are on the line.

They're greedy, careless, awful creatures, and I hate them all.",

"Was it only three years ago, when the shogunate met with the Inkling council for kind meetings?
I even called one of them my friend.  A kind manner, hope for the future and a charming smile, the dastard. We had dreams of what could have been.

But it's time to throw that all away.
The past is just a warning for the future, and no more. We will rise again, by my tentacles if we must.

-- General of the Dofleini-E Division, MA 2616"
