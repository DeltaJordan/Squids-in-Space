"Many relics of the past persist in Inkling culture today: the wars of years ago have shaped mindsets and hopes for the future, while the wreckage of past civilizations are constantly being studied. 

One such leftover of wars is the New Squidbeak Splatoon, a vigilante justice and intel group.",
	
"Formed initially as a small-scale intelligence force in the city-state of Cephedo, the original Squidbeak Splatoon was made to act as an information network and a backup weapon against political troubles. 
	
However, after the Great Turf War broke out, the group was quickly renovated into a well-trained squadron used almost exclusively against opposing Octarian forces.",
	
"This hybrid organization of espionage and guerrilla warfare proved highly successful on both its respective fronts, being quick to gather details on Octarian machinery so that viable countermeasures could be developed. 

Those secrets were also used well for the Splatoon's own weapons, leading to the development of the Bamboozler MK I, which soon became their signature weapon. Today, the model remains a relic of the War.",
	
"After the war ended, the original Squidbeak Splatoon's utility rapidly declined as efforts were turned towards the development of treaties and the rebuilding of cities. It swiftly faded into obscurity until the Octarian Uprising of MA 2730, as well as its sequel two years later.
	
Lead by the war veteran Craig Cuttlefish, the New Squidbeak Splatoon was formed, with a couple of new Inklings recruited from the streets as undercover agents. Unlike the original, the NSS was formed and run without government approval.",
	
"Once the attempted uprising was successfully quelled, the NSS remained a secret among the formal goverment, but remained a way of life for the few cephalopod youth involved.

It seems that its inspiration has reached to the stars in the past couple years, with the occasional rogue Inkling donning the blue, black and green colors of the NSS. The original Agents deny any connections to these starfarers."
