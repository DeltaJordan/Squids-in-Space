"''The world is changing. 
 
The land holds so much promise for so many people of all walks of life, but it's being engulfed by the ocean before our very eyes. We don't have to fight over the rights to it all, do we? With technology as it is, I can't imagine a full-blown war, not after all the years of friendship between our kinds. 

We can't just throw that all away.'' 
-- T. Apodd, civilian, 10-18: MA 2614",
	
"''It's done. War has been announced, and we're to blame. I never wanted this to happen, but the constant intrusions and conflicts over borderlines have proven too much for the Agency to continue ignoring. 

Various city-states of non-inkfolk persuasions have declared neutrality, but many Cephidan residents, regardless of their race, seem eager to support the cause. I may resign soon.'' 
-- A. Ubhook, Vibrance-C3 Agent, 10-34: MA 2614",
	
"''I can hear no more than my hearts pounding in my chest: Kurakai Island has been taken. 

We were struck in the dead hours of morning, where many of us missed the ventilation stirring overhead, and soon it was too late. We were outcompeted by the terrible vigilance of Octarian forces: they move smartly and with horrible tenacity, and it is a miracle my platoon has escaped unscathed.'' 
-- S. Jotaiyan, Platoon J18, 11-28: MA 2614",
	
"''Barely four months, and I'm exhausted. We cannot continue like this, dividing energy between defense and development of weaponry.. our resources already run low, and we swim with twisted tentacles. 

Shogun Octaiki has spoken of how we must pull ourselves together to protect our society.. but what miracles can we hope for? The surface kettles rattle with bombshells, leaving few able to sleep.'' 
-- K. Aecific, Lunulata Division, 15-3: MA 2614",
	
"''Reports have begun to flood in after the taking of the city of Zaitakon: massive war-machines are being constructed in kettles below the surface. They have a distinct focus on widespread collateral damage and chemical warfare, and run exclusively on a system of electrical current supplied by gigantic mobile generators. 
If victory is possibly in our future, we must swiftly create countermeasures.'' 
-- C. Sepidae, Intelligence-CX Agent, 1-18: MA 2615",
	
"''Tomorrow's the big day. The four superweapons are being prepared right now to be moved into the Inkling capital by other Elites. 

I don't want to imagine the destruction, but it's necessary at this point. If we show them how powerful we really are, then maybe they'll finally back down.

We can't afford to lose, not after all we've been through.'' 
-- Z. Entera, Dofleini-E Division, 9-27: MA 2616"
