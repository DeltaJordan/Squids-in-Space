"After an apocalyptic flood that wiped out much of the life on their home planet, squids climbed onto land and evolved into what we know today as Inklings. 

They're capable shapeshifters, able to change between humanoid form and squid form at leisure, and typically take an upright form for most of their daily activities.",

"They are very intelligent and friendly by nature and speak in high-pitched, watery voices. Most striking about them are their bright colors and patterns, which they can change at will, and the sticky squid ink that they use in self-defense.
Curiously, they have absolutely no bones! Shaking an Inkling's hand is like squishing gelatin between your fingers.",
	
"Their lifestyles are full of festivals and fun, and they focus primarily on the good things in life. Being able to live more than a hundred years, Inklings are often determined to spend every second of it having a fun time, whether it's exploring abandoned places or having a wild night out.

They can be a bit lazy when it comes to working or getting up early, though.",
	
"Despite their good nature, however, they can be slow to warm up to other races. Many Inklings hold an age-old prejudice against their genetic cousins, a race of sapient octopuses called Octolings, and this caution can extend to other unfamiliar races as well.

Perhaps the best way to befriend an Inkling is to be patient and outgoing. They have a particularly good nature towards other species with bright colors on their body, and so are naturally friendly to Avians, Floran and Hylotl."
